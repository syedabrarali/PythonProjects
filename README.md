# PythonProjects

##Project Number 1: LifeinWeeks
 - Its a simple file which prints out the number of days weeks and months if you have left to live if you input your age.
 

##Project Number 2: SplitBill
 - Here we take inputs of 1) bill Amount, 2) % of tip to be given 3) No of people splitting the bill
 - The output we get is each person's share of the bill.

##Project Number 3: InputAdventure
      - Treasure Island
     Instructions:
    -  Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in        your program.

    -  To write your code according to my story, you can use this flow chart from draw.io to help you.

    -  However, I think the fun part is writing your own story üòä

     üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üêä üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßü üßö‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü•∑ ü§ñ üëΩ üôÄ

    -  That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...

     Text Snippets from my example
     'You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
     'You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
     "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
     "It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
     "You found the treasure! You Win!"
     "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
     "You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
     "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
     "You fell into a hole. Game Over."
     Escaping Characters
     If you want to use multiple sets of quotes inside a single string, you might have to "escape" some of them using the backslash \. You can see this in      my first sentence: 'You're at a crossroad...'. More on escaping characters here.

    -  Extensions
       Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case-sensitive. In other words, your code should work                  regardless of whether your user answers "left" or "Left".

     - You can also add your own ASCII art. Just remember to add three single quotes ''' at the start and at the end of your artwork to turn it into a             multi-line string.
